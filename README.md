# react-starter
Hi, we're glad you are here to become more familiar with React through the Hack@Brown starter kit. We will go over the fundamentals regarding the set up, specific syntax (most important points), and testing in React.

React is a prevalently used Javascript Library to construct high-quality UIs. The main goal of this kit is to provide you with the necessary tools and the versatile basis from where you can launch off and learn more about the language on your own time. For any further questions, feel free to ask someone or refer to the [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
## Getting Started
There are two main ways you can start using react. One is by adding it to a [pre-existing HTML file](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) or using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Create React App is a comfortable environment for getting the hang of React, and is great tool for creating new single-page applications in React.
