# React-starter
Hi, welcome to Hack@Brown's React starter kit! We will go over how to set up and start your React app, as well as other useful packages.

React is the most prevalently used Javascript Library to construct high-quality UIs. The main goal of this kit is to provide you with the necessary tools and versatile basis from where you can launch off and learn more via experimentation. For any further questions, feel free to ask someone or refer to the [official React documentation](https://react.dev/).

## Getting Started
There are two main ways you can start using React. One is by adding it to a [pre-existing HTML file](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) or using [Create React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project). 

This repository contains an off-the-shelf React app installed with `npm` and Typescript with a [Next.js framework](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/create-nextjs-app). Next.js is a great tool for page routing and navigation. This configuration is common, but you can refer to the [React docs](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you prefer to use other package managers such as `yarn` or frameworks such as `Gatsby`. React highly reccomends using a framework such as Next.js, but it is not necessary depending on your use case! 

If you'd like to get started right away with this basic configuration, you can simply clone this repository and run `npm install && cd my-app && npm start` to start your app!   

## Supplemental packages
React supports many amazing frameworks for building robust full-stack applications. Here are some popular ones:

### Tailwind CSS:
Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that allows for inline CSS styling. Tailwind is a great tool for writing faster, custom CSS. You can add Tailwind to your React app by following [these instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app).

### Material UI: 
Material UI provides example templates for React components and simple pages such as buttons, alerts, sign-up pages, etc.  You can use these templates as they come or customize them. You can add Material UI to your React app by following [these instructions](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/) and access the components by opening the sidebar.
