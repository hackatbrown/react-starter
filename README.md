# react-starter
Hi, we're glad you are here to become more familiar with React through the Hack@Brown starter kit. We will go over the fundamentals regarding the set up, specific syntax (most important points), and testing in React.

React is the most prevalently used Javascript Library to construct high-quality UIs. The main goal of this kit is to provide you with the necessary tools and versatile basis from where you can launch off and learn more via experimentation. For any further questions, feel free to ask someone or refer to the [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
## Getting Started
There are two main ways you can start using React. One is by adding it to a [pre-existing HTML file](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) or using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/). Please follow the steps for setting up Create React App in the latter link. Create React App is a comfortable, starter-friendly environment for familiarizing oneself with React, and is a great tool for creating single-page applications.
