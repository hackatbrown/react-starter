# react-starter
Hi, we're glad you are here to become more familiar with React through the Hack@Brown starter kit. We will go over the fundamentals regarding the set up, specific syntax (most important points), and testing in React.

React is a prevalently used Javascript Library to construct high-quality UIs. The main goal of this kit is provide you with the necessary tools and a versatile basis from where you can launch off and learn more on your own time. For any deeper or further questions, feel free to refer to the official React documentation at https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html.
